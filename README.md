## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### 1. **Crowd Monitoring and Analysis**
**Description**:  
This project focuses on using machine learning and computer vision techniques for crowd monitoring and analysis. It aims to detect crowd density, monitor crowd movement patterns, and provide insights for safety and crowd management in public events.

**Features**:  
- Implemented **object detection** using pre-trained models (e.g., YOLO or Faster R-CNN) to track individuals in a crowd.  
- Used **density estimation** models to estimate the crowd's density and ensure safety levels.  
- Analyzed **movement patterns** using tracking algorithms to detect anomalies or overcrowding.  
- Visualized results in real-time using **Matplotlib** and **OpenCV** for easy interpretation.  
- Deployed the model using a **Flask web application** to provide real-time crowd analytics and insights.  

**Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLO, Flask, Matplotlib


## üöÄ Key Highlights
- Experience with **Computer Vision** and **Object Detection** techniques.  
- Proficiency in **Crowd Density Estimation** and **Movement Pattern Analysis**.  
- Hands-on experience with **real-time data visualization** and **model deployment** using Flask.  
- Focus on **AI for public safety** and smart city applications.
